            <h3>Trep: Dynamic Simulation and Optimal Control</h3>

            <p>Trep is a Python module for modeling articulated rigid body mechanical systems in generalized coordinates. Trep supports basic simulation but it is primarily designed to serve as a calculation engine for analysis and optimal control algorithms that require 1st and 2nd derivatives of the system's dynamics.</p>

            <p>Get started by installing trep and checking out the documentation.</p>

            <p>Trep is designed to work with large mechanical systems in generalized coordinates. This video shows the progress of a discrete time trajectory optimization that was created with trep.</p>

            <p>Trep currently features:
            <ul>
                <li>Concise System Definitions</li>
                <li>Conservative Forces (Potential Energies)</li>
                <li>Non-Conservative forces</li>
                <li>Holonomic Constraints</li>
                <li>Continuous Dynamics</li>
