.. currentmodule:: trep

Non-conservative forces are modeled in trep by deriving from the
:class:`Force` type.  These types of forces include damping and
control forces/torques.  

These are the types of forces currently built in to :mod:`trep`.
:ref:`creating_forces` describes how to create a new type of force in
Python or C.
