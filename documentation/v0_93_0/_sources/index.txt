Trep: Dynamic Simulation and Optimal Control
============================================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

Trep is a Python module for modeling rigid body mechanical systems in
generalized coordinates.  It provides tools for calculating continuous
and discrete dynamics (based on a midpoint variational integrator),
and the first and second derivatives of both.  Tools for trajectory
optimization and other basic optimal control methods are also available.

We're still getting all of this documentation together.  You can find
detailed `installation instructions
<http://murpheylab.github.io/trep/install/>`_ on our website.
Many examples are included with the source code (`browse online
<https://github.com/MurpheyLab/trep/tree/master/examples>`_).

The :ref:`api reference` has detailed documentation for each part of
:mod:`trep`. We have also put together a detailed :ref:`tutorial` that gives an
idea of the capabilities and organization of :mod:`trep` by stepping through
several example problems.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please head over to our
`project page <http://murpheylab.github.io/trep/>`_.
