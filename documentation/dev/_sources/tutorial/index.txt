Tutorial
========================================
More information on trep can be found on the `trep project website
<http://code.google.com/p/trep>`_.

This tutorial is meant to be an introduction to :mod:`trep` by walking the
reader through extended examples. This tutorial will use a Python shell known as
`IPython <http://ipython.org>`_ for illustrating the organization of trep's
components. It is recommended that IPython is downloaded and installed, although
the tutorial is still useful without access to IPython.
