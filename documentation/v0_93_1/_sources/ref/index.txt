API Reference
=============

:mod:`trep` is a Python module for simulation and trajectory
optimization of mechanical systems in generalized coordinates.  

The dynamics can be modeled in continuous time as a traditional ODE,
or in discrete time using variational integrators.

The central component of :mod:`trep` is the :class:`System`
class. A :class:`System` is a collection of coordinate frames,
forces, potential energies, and constraints that describe a mechanical
system in generalized coordinates.  The :class:`System` is capable
of calculating the continuous dynamics and the first and second
derivatives of the dynamics.
