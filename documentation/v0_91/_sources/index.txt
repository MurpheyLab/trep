Trep: Dynamic Simulation and Optimal Control
============================================

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

Trep is a Python module for modeling rigid body mechanical systems in
generalized coordinates.  Trep is designed to be fast, easy to use,
and easy to extend.  Trep currently features:

- Concise System Definitions
- Conservative Forces (Potential Energies)
- Non-Conservative forces
- Holonomic Constraints
- Continuous Dynamics
- Exact 1\ :sup:`st` and 2\ :sup:`nd` derivatives of continuous dynamics
- Discrete Dynamics using Variational Integrators
- Exact 1\ :sup:`st` and 2\ :sup:`nd` derivatives of discrete dynamics
- Projection-based Trajectory Optimization in discrete time
- Automatic Visualization Tools
- Excellent Scalability

We're still getting all of this documentation together.  For now,
check out the :ref:`installation` page to get setup using :mod:`trep`
and checkout the :mod:`module reference <trep>`.
