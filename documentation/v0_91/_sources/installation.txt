Currently trep is only available as a source distribution that must be
compiled on your machine.  


Prerequisites
-------------

To install trep, you will need the following dependencies.

* `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ (>=2.6) (including development header files)
* `Numpy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ (>=1.4.1)  (including development header files)
* `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
* (Optional) `PyOpenGL <http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/>`_  
* (Optional) `PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ 
* (Optional) `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ 
* (Optional) `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ 

The optional packages are required to use the visualization tools
provided by trep. You also need a C compiler installed and configured
properly to compile Python extensions.

General Installation
--------------------

To install trep, you will need to install any missing prerequisites,
download the source code, and build/install the package using the
include setup script.  Trep has been developed and tested on Debian
Linux and Mac OS X, but should be portable to any system supported by
Python and Numpy.  Detailed instructions are provided for
:ref:`Debian <debian-install>` and :ref:`OS X <osx-install>`.

Download the `latest release
<https://github.com/MurpheyLab/trep/releases>`_ of trep and
unpack the archive. In the unpacked directory, run python setup.py
build. If your build environment is properly installed, the script
will compile trep. Install the package by running python setup.py
install in the same directory (On Mac OS X and Linux this requires
super user privileges).

You can test the installation by importing the trep module in Python::
  
  >>> import trep 

If the import succeeds, trep is properly installed.  Once trep is
installed, you can check out the many examples provided in the
``examples`` sub-directory, or start reading the :ref:`user-guide`.

Documentation
-------------

The current documentation can be viewed or downloaded directly from
the website.  If you want to modify or build the documentation, you
will need to install `Sphinx <http://http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.  To
build the documentation, change to the ``doc`` sub-directory and type
``make html``.  The build output will be located in
``doc/build/html``.  Additionally, you can type ``make help`` to see
other output types, including LaTeX.
