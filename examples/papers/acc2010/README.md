Notes:
------
This Python script provides an implementation of the example noted in the ACC 2010 publication. This script uses trep to calculate the continuous linearizations using the same framework described in the publication. Due to numerical differences and possible errors in the original code, the results from this implementation will differ slightly from those reported in the publication.
