### 1. Install with MacPorts

Mark Moll, one of the core developers of the [Open Motion Planning Library](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/), has created a [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) package for trep.  If you have MacPorts installed, just update your package index with:

    sudo port selfupdate

and install trep with:

    sudo port install py27-trep

Alternatively, you can install py26-trep for Python 2.6. (Thanks Mark!)
