### 1.1. Installing with MacPorts

Mark Moll, one of the core developers of the [Open Motion Planning Library](http://ompl.kavrakilab.org/), has created a [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) package for trep.  If you have MacPorts installed, just update your package index with:

    sudo port selfupdate

and install trep with:

    sudo port install py27-trep

Alternatively, you can install py26-trep for Python 2.6. (Thanks Mark!)

### 1.2. Installing with pip

Trep can be also be installed from the Python Package Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html). See the Linux installation instructions for more details and required prerequisite packages.
