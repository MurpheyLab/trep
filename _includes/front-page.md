### Trep: Dynamic Simulation and Optimal Control
Trep is a Python module for modeling articulated rigid body mechanical systems in generalized coordinates. Trep supports basic simulation but it is primarily designed to serve as a calculation engine for analysis and optimal control algorithms that require 1st and 2nd derivatives of the system's dynamics.

Get started by installing trep and checking out the documentation.

Trep is designed to work with large mechanical systems in generalized coordinates. This video shows the progress of a discrete time trajectory optimization that was created with trep.

Trep currently features:

- Concise System Definitions
- Conservative Forces (Potential Energies)
- Non-Conservative forces
- Holonomic Constraints
- Continuous Dynamics
- Exact 1st and 2nd derivatives of continuous dynamics
- Discrete Dynamics using variational integrators
- Exact 1st and 2nd derivatives of discrete dynamics
- Projection-based Trajectory Optimization in discrete time
- Automatic Visualization Tools
- Excellent Scalability
